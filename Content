# About

Hello! I'm a software engineer, teacher, and motivational speaker. I focus on helping others achieve their full potential via cognitive coaching, which combines effective learning techniques and psychology concepts.

## Background

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2014. I then took a year to delve into aromatherapy and holistic healing, and I have since returned to software engineering with a renewed interest in its potential to help people.

## Next steps

Currently, my focus is on creating intelligent learning software, as well as applications that allow people to connect more meaningfully.

I am also interested in further developing my coaching and public speaking skills. At my current job, I lecture in front of 80 people every day, and I spend 20 hours a week mentoring junior developers.

## Other stuff I enjoy

Music: I can pick out a tune on the piano or violin pretty easily, but I find figuring out the harmonies, or chords, much more challenging (and rewarding!).

Foreign languages: I speak English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, and, once upon a time, Russian.

Foosball: I like foosball a lot. Over the summers in college, I taught offensive and defensive strategy for beginners.
