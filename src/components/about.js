          Hello! I'm a software engineer, teacher, and motivational speaker.
          I focus on helping others achieve their full potential via cognitive coaching,
          which combines effective learning techniques and psychology concepts.
        </p>

        <h3 className="about-heading">Background</h3>

        <p>
          I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2014.
          I then took a year to delve into aromatherapy and holistic healing,
          and I have since returned to software engineering with a renewed interest
          in its potential to help people.
        </p>

        <h3 className="about-heading">Next steps</h3>

        <p>
          Currently, my focus is on creating intelligent learning software,
          as well as applications that allow people to connect more meaningfully.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also interested in further developing my coaching and public speaking skills.
          At my current job, I lecture in front of 80 people every day,
          and I spend 20 hours a week mentoring junior developers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="about-heading">Other stuff I enjoy</h3>

        <p>
          Music: I can pick out a tune on the piano or violin pretty easily,
          but I find figuring out the harmonies, or chords, much more challenging (and rewarding!).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Foreign languages: I speak English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Japanese,
          and, once upon a time, Russian.
        </p>

        <p>
          Foosball: I like foosball a lot. Over the summers in college,
          I taught offensive and defensive strategy for beginners.
