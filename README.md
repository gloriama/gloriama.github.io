# Gloria Ma - Personal Website

This is a work in progress.

Visit the site live at [gloriama.github.io](https://gloriama.github.io)!

## Tech Stack

The site was built in React/Redux.

## Terminal Commands

After cloning down the repo, you will need to use the following commands:

### For development: ```npm start```

This starts the webpack dev server, which will automatically update and serve a ```bundle.js``` file from your local server on port 8080. This is used to make development more convenient.

### For production: ```webpack```

This creates the static ```bundle.js``` file of all JavaScript/ES6 needed for the app. Do this before pushing production changes to the repo, so that the corresponding GitHub Pages site will reflect your latest changes.

## Acknowledgments

I used Stephen Grider's [React/Redux starter repo](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) to get set up. It includes the barebones of a React/Redux app and all the Webpack and Babel configuration needed to get off the ground. Definitely check it out if you are new to React/Redux and want to create your own app!
